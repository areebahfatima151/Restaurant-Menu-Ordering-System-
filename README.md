# Restaurant-Menu-Ordering-System

This is a beginner-friendly, console-based restaurant ordering system developed in Python. It allows users to view a predefined menu, select items to order, and calculates the total bill based on their choices.

**How It Works:**

1. The user is welcomed and shown a list of available menu items with prices.
2. The user enters the name of the first item they want to order.
3. The program checks if the item exists in the menu and adds its price to the total.
4. The user is then asked if they want to add a second item.

5. If yes, the process repeats for the second item.

6. The total bill is displayed at the end based on selected items.
